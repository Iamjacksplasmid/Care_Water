# Care_Water
Care Water Project, developed for TrueSense Marketing

"Photo book" landing page that accompanied a mailer, depicting the journey of a young girl named Precious as she gathered water for her family each day.
It was meant to show how dangerous this journey was, how the water often wasn't safe to drink, and how CARE's well installation improved her and her family's lives.

Utilizes basic animation to create a "sweep" effect, where scrolling wipes each image in the journey and replaces it with the next/previous one.
